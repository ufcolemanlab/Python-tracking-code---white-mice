# Python-tracking-code---white-mice  

Code used by the Coleman lab for tracking mice in video files (white mice on a black background = WB).  

We use files generated by a Raspberry Pi camera (*.h264 files).  

Test/example files (*.mp4 and *.h264) files are included in the directory.  

Use the following scripts together:  
selectROIwb_4.py - Set field bounds and object to track; run first to select field corners and subject (mouse)  
batch_trackWB_vet_1.py - Vet the ROIs; run second to verify all mice are being tracked  
batch_trackWB_4.py - Generates the data; run this script once tracking ROIs are validated, set and working
